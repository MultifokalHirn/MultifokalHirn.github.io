My name is Lennard Wolf and I am a programmer working and living in Berlin, Germany.

I am Tech Lead at [Signatrix](https://www.signatrix.com), where I contribute to the development of a suite of computer vision applications and the infrastructure around them.

*IRL* I prefer spending time with my wife and dog, doing gardening/renovation work, or finding an outlet for my creativity in music, visual art, or audiobook adjacent formats.
