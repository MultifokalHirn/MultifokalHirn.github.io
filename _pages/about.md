<span>
    My name is Lennard Wolf and I am a programmer working and living in Berlin, Germany.
    <br />
    I am Tech Lead at <a class="link-in-text" href="https://www.signatrix.com">Signatrix</a>, where I contribute to the development of a suite of computer vision applications and the infrastructure around them.

<br />

<span>
    Professionally, I focus on classic software engineering, preferably using Python (see my <a class="link" href="{{ "/resume" | relative_url }}">CV</a> for more details).
    <br />
    <i>IRL</i> I prefer spending time with my wife and dog, doing gardening/renovation work, or finding an outlet for my creativity in music, visual art, or audiobook adjacent formats.
