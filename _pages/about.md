Hello, my name is Lennard Wolf and I am a Software Engineer from Berlin, where I am working as a consultant with the wonderful people of [*amiconsult*](https://amiconsult.de) (/ˈaː.mi.kənˈsʌlt/).
In the past I had joined the startup [*Signatrix*](https://www.signatrix.com) as the first full-time Software Engineering hire, where for 5 years I worked closely with the technical co-founders on implementing the company's lineup of AI (computer vision) products, setting up infrastructure for QA and CI/CD (which included testing and deploying the products & AI models on various CPU/GPU hardware), as well as developing the company's in-house toolchain for collecting, storing, versioning, annotating, and selectively exporting training data for the AI (deep learning) models.
