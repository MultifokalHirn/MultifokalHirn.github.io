<span>
    My name is Lennard Wolf and I am a programmer working and living in Berlin, Germany.
    <br />
    I am Tech Lead at <a href="https://www.signatrix.com"><i>Signatrix</i></a>, where I contribute to the development of a suite of computer vision applications and the infrastructure around them.

<br />
<br />

<span>
    Professionally, my focus is classic software engineering, as well as creating (infra-)structures to ensure robust processes and/or environments (see my <a class="link" href="{{ "/resume" | relative_url }}">CV</a> for more details).
    <br />
    <i>IRL</i> I prefer spending time with my wife and dog, doing gardening/renovation work, or finding an outlet for my creativity in music, visual art, or audiobook adjacent formats.
