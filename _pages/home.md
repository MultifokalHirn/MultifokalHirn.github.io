Hi, my name is [Lennard Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennardwolf/) and I am a Software Engineer from Berlin, currently working as Tech Lead at [*Signatrix*](https://www.signatrix.com).

After receiving my B.Sc in *IT System Engineering* from [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de), I was went on to study *Philosophy* at [Humboldt University](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de).
During those studies I met one of the founders of a (back then) very early stage computer vision startup named [Signatrix](https://www.signatrix.com), which I joined as the first non-founding Software Engineer half a year later.
