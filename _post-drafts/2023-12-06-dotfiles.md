I have created a public [repository](https://github.com/MultifokalHirn/.dotfiles) for my `.dotfiles`.

For now, this repository mainly consists of:

- configuration for
  - `zsh`
  - `git`
  - `ruby gem`
- a `Brewfile` with `brew` packages I consider essential

I mainly use devices running  macOS, so some of the topics here may be specific
to that operating system. However, most of the config files are platform
agnostic and can be used anywhere you would want to use them.
