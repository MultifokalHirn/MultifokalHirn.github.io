I have created a [repository](github.com/MultifokalHirn/.dotfiles) for my `.dotfiles`.

For now, it mainly consists of:

- documentation on how to set up a machine based on this repository
- configuration for
  - `zsh`
  - `git`
  - `ruby gem`
- a `Brewfile` with `brew` packages I consider essential

I will add more content to this repository over time.

The `README.md` of the repository is included below:
<!-- <div id="readme" class="readme blob instapaper_body markdown-body"> -->
  <!-- <article class=" entry-content container-lg" itemprop="text"> -->
        {% remote_include "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MultifokalHirn/.dotfiles/main/README.md" %}
    <!-- </article> -->
<!-- </div> -->
